# Food-Automat
An algorithm for filling and emptying the food vending machine.
The Gym Meal Machine (GMM) is an automated vending system designed to meet the dietary needs of individuals such as athletes, bodybuilders, and dancers by providing customizable meal options. The machine allows users to select meals based on specific nutritional requirements like protein, carbohydrate, fat, or calorie content, or directly by slot number. It is equipped with a dynamic loading mechanism that organizes products efficiently, calculates calorie values using nutritional data, and handles inventory management. Users can make purchases with various denominations, and the system ensures accurate transaction handling, including returning change or displaying informative messages if a purchase cannot be completed. By leveraging Object-Oriented Programming principles, the GMM firmware integrates functionality, scalability, and user-friendliness to offer a seamless and efficient meal selection experience.
